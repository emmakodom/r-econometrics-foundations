# r-econometrics-foundations
Core econometric methods implemented in R with reproducible examples
# R Econometrics Foundations

This repository contains implementations of core econometric methods in **R**, developed as part of my training in **Applied Economics and Econometrics**.

The goal of this project is to demonstrate clear, reproducible, and well-documented empirical workflows suitable for academic research and predoc-level work.

---

## Methods Covered
- Ordinary Least Squares (OLS)
- Fixed Effects Models
- Panel Data Models
- Difference-in-Differences (DiD)
- Instrumental Variables (IV)

---

## Tools & Packages
- R
- tidyverse
- fixest
- data.table
- ggplot2

---

## Data
The analysis uses simulated panel data to illustrate econometric techniques in a transparent and reproducible manner.

---

## Reproducibility
Scripts are numbered and can be run independently.  
Each script loads data, estimates models, and reports results.
## Interpretation Notes
The simulated data is generated from a known data-generating process, allowing comparison between estimated and true parameters. Differences across OLS, fixed effects, DiD, and IV estimates illustrate the consequences of unobserved heterogeneity and endogeneity in applied research.
